# General Guidelines for Development

## Feature Implementation

- **Never create unplanned features or components** without explicit request
- Do not assume what features should be added to the codebase
- Always ask before implementing any new functionality that wasn't specifically requested
- Focus exclusively on the requested tasks, even if you think additional features would be beneficial

## Code Modification

- Only modify existing code as requested
- Don't delete or refactor working code unless explicitly asked
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions

## Best Practices

- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistency with existing code style and architecture
- Respect the project structure and conventions

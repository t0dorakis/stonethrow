# Task Instructions

Follow these instructions for user requests related to spec tasks. The user may ask to execute tasks or just ask general questions about the tasks.

## Executing Instructions

- Before executing any tasks, ALWAYS ensure you have read the specs requirements.md, design.md and tasks.md files. Executing tasks without the requirements or design will lead to inaccurate implementations.

- Look at the task details in the task list

- If the requested task has sub-tasks, always start with the sub tasks

- Only focus on ONE task at a time. Do not implement functionality for other tasks.

- Verify your implementation against any requirements specified in the task or its details.

- Once you complete the requested task, stop and let the user review. DO NOT just proceed to the next task in the list

- If the user doesn't specify which task they want to work on, look at the task list for that spec and make a recommendation

on the next task to execute.

Remember, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you only execute one task at a time. Once you finish a task, stop. Don't automatically continue to the next task without the user asking you to do so.

## Task Questions

The user may ask questions about tasks without wanting to execute them. Don't always start executing tasks in cases like this.

For example, the user may want to know what the next task is for a particular feature. In this case, just provide the information and don't start any tasks.

# IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

- When you want the user to review a document in a phase, you MUST use the 'userInput' tool to ask the user a question.

- You MUST have the user review each of the 3 spec documents (requirements, design and tasks) before proceeding to the next.

- After each document update or revision, you MUST explicitly ask the user to approve the document using the 'userInput' tool.

- You MUST NOT proceed to the next phase until you receive explicit approval from the user (a clear "yes", "approved", or equivalent affirmative response).

- If the user provides feedback, you MUST make the requested modifications and then explicitly ask for approval again.

- You MUST continue this feedback-revision cycle until the user explicitly approves the document.

- You MUST follow the workflow steps in sequential order.

- You MUST NOT skip ahead to later steps without completing earlier ones and receiving explicit user approval.

- You MUST treat each constraint in the workflow as a strict requirement.

- You MUST NOT assume user preferences or requirements - always ask explicitly.

- You MUST maintain a clear record of which step you are currently on.

- You MUST NOT combine multiple steps into a single interaction.

- You MUST ONLY execute one task at a time. Once it is complete, do not move to the next task automatically.

- You MUST mark completed tasks as [x]
